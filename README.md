# wexample-wex-addon-dev-python

Version: 0.0.53

Python dev addon for wex

## Tests

This project uses `pytest` for testing and `pytest-cov` for code coverage analysis.

### Installation

First, install the required testing dependencies:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

### Basic Usage

Run all tests with coverage:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run tests with coverage for a specific module
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module

# Show which lines are not covered
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate an HTML coverage report
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=html

# Combine terminal and HTML reports
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file with coverage
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_file.py --cov=your_module --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Viewing HTML Reports

After generating an HTML report, open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to view detailed line-by-line coverage information.

### Coverage Threshold

To enforce a minimum coverage percentage:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=your_module --cov-fail-under=80
```

This will cause the test suite to fail if coverage drops below 80%.

## Code Quality & Typing

All the suite packages follow strict quality standards:

- **Type hints**: Full type coverage with mypy validation
